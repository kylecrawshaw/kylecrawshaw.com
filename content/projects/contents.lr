ImagrAdmin is a Cocoa app for macOS to create and update [Imagr](https://imagr.io) workflows. Imagr is built 
around the idea of one main configuration file that contains workflows with a number of different components. 
Before ImagrAdmin you would have to know what keys you could set for the different workflow components. 
ImagrAdmin attempts to ease that process so you can focus on creating great scripts and packages to be installed 
with Imagr.
